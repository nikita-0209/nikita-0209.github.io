<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Nikita Saxena is a Research Engineer at Google DeepMind, working on enhancing the multimodal understanding and generation capabilities of Gemini. She collaborates closely with [Ishita Dasgupta](https://ishita-dg.github.io/) and [Isabelle Guyon](https://guyon.chalearn.org/).

Previously, Nikita was an AI Resident at [Google Research India](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/), where she worked under the guidance of [Evan Shelhamer](http://imaginarynumber.net/) and [Alok Talekar](https://research.google/people/106902/). She contributed to developing an AI-powered API for agricultural solutions, using satellite imagery for precision farming and afforestation mapping. 

She graduated with first distinction from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2023 with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and a Master’s in Physics. For her thesis, Nikita worked at [Mila Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en) under the supervision of [Professor Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/), alongside [Moksh Jain](https://mj10.github.io/) and [Alex Hernandez Garcia](https://alexhernandezgarcia.github.io/), where she developed GFlowNets for Scientific Discovery. In the past, she has also conducted research with [Professor Tilman Plehn (Heidelberg University)](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~plehn/), [Professor Taritree Wongjirad](https://as.tufts.edu/physics/people/faculty/taritree-wongjirad) ([IAIFI](https://iaifi.github.io/), [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/)), and [Vinti Agarwal (BITS Pilani)](https://vinti8776.github.io/v_agarwal//).

Nikita is a recipient of the [DAAD-WISE](https://www.daad.in/en/2023/09/20/applications-invited-working-internships-in-science-and-engineering-wise-2023-24/), [Charpak Lab](https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/france-excellence-charpak-summer-training-scholarship), and [MITACS Globalink](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-award-students-postdocs/) scholarships. She is committed to supporting the research community and currently serves on the [Women in Machine Learning Workshop (WiML) Board](https://www.wiml.org/directors).

Outside of work, Nikita enjoys reading (feel free to connect on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173068668-nikita-saxena) - love book recs!), gardening, trekking, and traveling — especially to off-beaten places (Kazakhstan is next on her list!). She loves trying new cuisines and meeting new people, fascinated by how different experiences shape us and how perspectives can align or diverge despite similar or contrasting backgrounds. Since moving to San Francisco in late 2024, she has been focused on building her community and exploring new activities — improv and salsa are next on her list!
