abstract = {Space-borne satellite radiometers measure Sea Surface Temperature (SST), which is pivotal to studies of air-sea interactions and ocean features. Under clear sky conditions, high resolution measurements are obtainable. But under cloudy conditions, data analysis is constrained to the available low resolution measurements. We assess the efficiency of Deep Learning (DL) architectures, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to downscale oceanographic data from low spatial resolution (SR) to high SR. With a focus on SST Fields of Bay of Bengal, this study proves that Very Deep Super Resolution CNN can successfully reconstruct SST observations from 15 km SR to 5km SR, and 5km SR to 1km SR. This outcome calls attention to the significance of DL models explicitly trained for the reconstruction of high SR SST fields by using low SR data. Inference on DL models can act as a substitute to the existing computationally expensive downscaling technique: Dynamical Downsampling. The complete code is available on this Github Repository.},
